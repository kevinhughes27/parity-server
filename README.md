parity-server [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kevinhughes27/parity-server.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/kevinhughes27/parity-server)
=============

backend for parity league stats.

Parser
------
The parse is a standalone javascript module that converts `events` into `stats`. For more info checkout the [repository](https://github.com/kevinhughes27/parity-parser).


Server
------
  **Flow**:

    1. Stats Keeping Client `POSTs` a JSON object to the server.

    2. Node server receives the request parses the events into stats

    3. The game is saved to the database and a `201` is returned to the client

    4. All `games` processed by the app are visible at `/games` and each week of stats is at `/weeks`

    5. An app to view the data is served from '/'


Setup
-----

Dependencies:
  * node / npm
  * mongodb

Then run `npm install` to get the required modules.


Running:
--------
  To run the server locally by starting it with `npm run start` (or `auto-start` if developing)

  Then run the following command to send a job to the server:

  ```
  curl -X POST -d '{"week": 1, "events": ["Pull\tMike", "Direction\t<<<<<<", "POINT\tJill\tPass\tBob"]}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:3000/upload
  ```

  or you can send a full set of events from `test/files` using:

  ```
  curl -X POST --data @test/files/week1_game1.json -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:3000/upload
  ```

  To clear all the data saved in the database run `npm run db:reset`


Testing
-------
  run `npm test`

  to run a single test: `mocha <path_to_test> --grep <something unique in the test name>`


Front End
---------

To develop on the front end app you need to run `npm run start:frontend` then the script will open your browser to the app. You'll need to run the backend server as well in order to be able to fetch data.

Similarly for testing run `npm run test:frontend`
